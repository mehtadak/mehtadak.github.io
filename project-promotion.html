                <h2>VFX Manager</h2>
            
                <p>
                    I designed and implemented a centralized <strong>VFX Manager</strong> system responsible for spawning and managing all visual effects triggered by combat, abilities, and in-world interactions.
                    Instead of gameplay systems instantiating effects directly, all VFX requests are routed through this manager, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and scalability as the project grows.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The manager uses a <strong>Singleton</strong> pattern, allowing it to be accessed globally from any gameplay system while guaranteeing that only a single instance exists at runtime.
                    This avoids duplicate spawns, conflicting logic, and fragmented VFX handling across the codebase.
                </p>
            
                <h3>VFX Prefab Management</h3>
            
                <p>
                    To decouple gameplay logic from visual assets, I implemented a dictionary-based lookup system that maps string identifiers to their corresponding VFX prefabs.
                    Gameplay systems can request visual effects by name, without holding direct references to prefab assets.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    This design keeps gameplay code clean and modular, simplifies iteration on visual assets, and reduces technical debt by centralizing VFX ownership within a single system.
                </p>
            
                <h3>VFX Spawning, Scale & Lifetime Handling</h3>
            
                <p>
                    When a visual effect is requested, the VFX Manager spawns the appropriate prefab at the provided position and rotation, and optionally applies a custom <strong>scale parameter</strong> passed in by the caller.
                    This allows the same effect asset to be reused across different abilities, characters, or impact strengths without duplicating prefabs.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Each VFX is primarily responsible for managing its own lifetime, such as destroying itself once a particle system has finished playing.
                    As a safety measure, the manager also enforces a fallback cleanup mechanism that automatically destroys any effect that exceeds a maximum lifespan, preventing unintended resource leaks.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Designer Tools</h3>
            
                <p>
                    To support rapid iteration and empower non-programmers, I exposed editable offset values for individual VFX assets that designers can adjust directly in the editor.
                    This enables precise placement of visual effects relative to characters, weapons, or environmental interactions without requiring code changes.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Combined with runtime scale control, these tools give designers flexible control over the appearance and feel of effects while maintaining a clean and reusable asset pipeline.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Why This System Matters</h3>
            
                <p>
                    This VFX Manager provides a robust and extensible foundation for the game’s visual effects pipeline.
                    By centralizing effect spawning, supporting scalable reuse through parameterization, and incorporating safety-focused lifetime management, the system improves reliability, maintainability, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
                </p>

                <h2>Interactable System</h2>
                <p>
                    Any interaction with static objects, environments and/or sometimes players are processed here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All interactions are triggered through interact button in the action box. Game data is captured and relevant interaction script is called to perform interaction.
                </p>
                <h3>Integration with other systems</h3>
                <p>
                    All Interactables are calling multiple other systems to process the input from the player and execute the action based on the interactable.
                </p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Took feedback from designers to expose the relevant parameters in the inspector (GUI) with helpful tooltips and headers. Designers do not need to write code or modify scripts to modify values like range and damage

        <h2>Result and Impact</h2>
        <p>
            * This modular VFX system created a clean and easy way to manage VFX that allowed players to get dynamic visual feedback on inputs. Also helped designers to quickly change assets for prototyping<br>
            * Interactables increased player engagement by allowing them to engage with things other than enemies.
