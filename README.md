This is the HTML and CSS code for my portfoilio webpage.  
This is the tech stack I used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

I spent about 10 hours developing this website. Most of the time was spent on learning how to use JavaScript since I did not know how to.  
I have integrated my itch.io page into the website to showcase the various games I have built over the past couple of years.
There are links to LinkedIn and emails to help anyone browsing my website to connect with me!

I did some research on some modern UI trends and really like the muted pastel aesthetic that is getting super popular.
Incorporating it into my website was not much of a challenge since I settled on using only two basic colors that complement each other and nothing more.
